# Walking-Aid-for-Blind-people
In this project, a walking aid for blind people is created which can be attached to a walking stick which will help the blind person and work as an precaution for him as follows. 
When a blind person faces some obstruction in a range of 0.5m, then as per our circuit the led glows which can be replaced by a buzzer so that the blind person can become aware of it. At the same time a receipent or the friend or relative of the blind person will receive a mail saying "I am in danger. Please help me." This system is excuted by including an ultrasonic sensor for the distance measurement which is connected to the raspberry pi module and then connected to led which can be replaced by a buzzer. The system is linked to email via adafruit and ifttt which helps in sending mails to the receipent. Here, Raspberry pi 3B+ and ultrasonic sensor along with Raspberry pi software and Adafruit and IFTTT were the major components which played an important role.
